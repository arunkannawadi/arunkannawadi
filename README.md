### About me

I am currently an Assistant Research Professor of Physics at Duke University and was previously an [Associate Research Scholar](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/people/arun-kannawadi) at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, Princeton University.
I primarily work on the algorithms and software for the Science Pipelines of the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](www.lsst.org)ðŸ”­, formerly known as the [LSST](http://github.com/lsst).
My research interests are understanding the nature of dark matter and dark energy, both at a fundamental level and from a cosmological perspective.

Most of my code are hosted in the [LSST](http://github.com/lsst) and [LSSTDESC]((http://github.com/lsstdesc)) repositories on Github.
But you can find my fun side projects among my Github repositories.
